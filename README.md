Challenge: Make your own christmas ornament for the Frontend Department's interactive christmas tree.

Rules
1) This is the pure CSS-edition. No JS is allowed. No CSS preprocessor.
2) Please look at the example for how and where to put your code.
3) You will need to create your own unique css namespace and keep your work strictly within this.
4) You can edit the css + html. inline SVG is also possible.
5) You can use external files. Put them in the assets folder.
6) If you want something to happen to your ornament when itÂ´s clicked, I have added JS so every ornament will toggle an .active class when clicked.
7) The ornaments will automatically be placed on the tree by JS.
8) Max size for an ornamaent is 200px x 200px. It can have any shape.
9) Push your work to this repo. Deadline: before next department meeting.
10) No need to support old browsers.
11) Have fun (hopefully)
 
The result will be here: https://makingwaves.github.io/xmastree/

Merry Christmas and Good Luck!
