# xmastree

Make your own christmas ornament for the Frontend Department's interactive christmas tree.

Rules
1) This is the CSS-edition. No JS is allowed.
2) Please look at the example code.
3) You will need to create your own unique css namescope and keep your work strictly within this.
4) You can edit the css + html. inline SVG is possible.
5) You can use external files. 
6) If you want something to happen to your ornament when itÂ´s clicked, I have already added JS so every ornament will toggle an .active class.
7) Max size for an ornamaent is 200px x 200px.
8) Push your work to this repo. Deadline: before next department meeting.
9) No need to support old browsers.
 

Merry Christmas and Good Luck!
